Optimized text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, noise filtering) improving topic quality by ˜18%. Designed a modular, YAML- driven pipeline with logging and model registry for reproducible experimentation. Code •Credit Risk Prediction (Ensemble ML: LightGBM + XGBoost) :Built a credit risk prediction system using ensemble models (LightGBM + XGBoost), achieving F1-score: 96.1% and AUC ROC: 0.9888, significantly improving prediction reliability. Reduced false negatives by 16%, directly enhancing detection of high-risk borrowers and lowering potential default exposure. Designed a robust preprocessing pipeline (cate- gorical encoding, missing value imputation, risk binning) that improved F1 by +8%, yielding a 14% lift vs. baseline models. Developed a production-ready ML pipeline (ETL→training→evaluation→deployment), making it suitable for fintech loan approval systems .

Implemented an optimized preprocessing and tokenization pipeline for efficient model input and fast experimentation. Code •Alzheimer Disease Detection Using Hybrid CNN–Quantum Neural Network :Designed a hybrid learning framework integrating PQCs with classical neural layers for Alzheimer’s disease classification. Uti- lized rotation-based quantum encoding and CZ entanglement to capture complex feature correlations beyond classical limits. Achieved 98% overall accuracy, improving classification stability by +5% compared to baseline CNNs. Leveraged TensorFlow + Qiskit integration for hybrid training and quantum parameter optimization .
